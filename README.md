# AHK-scripts
My personal collection of AHK scripts, the motto here is quick and dirty

AHK is windows only

I use DVORAK, you have to adapt some of these for QWERTY

I have shortcuts in my startup folder to some of these

AHK download: https://www.autohotkey.com/

This is great for workshops: https://github.com/marius-sucan/KeyPress-OSD
